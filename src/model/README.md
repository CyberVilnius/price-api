# Purpose of this folder

Model is about describing all bussiness oriented logic, including all required data access.

We do actual access to data using mongoose as ORM - schemas folder.

Its up to you how to convert mongoose schemas into actual models, usable from controllers and other places - sportsApp folder and index.js is only example how mongoose schemas are mapped into actual bussiness layer.
